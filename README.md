â€‹    Unsupervised deep learning has been widely employed to generate high-quality point cloud samples. Although recent researches have demonstrated its ability to obtain remarkable results in point cloud generation task, the training stage is still computationally expensive and has a high utilization of GPU memory. This work develops a novel strategy for improving the performance of the generative model for point clouds by learning the priors using a score-based generative model in the wavelet domain. Taking advantage of the multi-scale representation provided by wavelet transform, the proposed model is more efficient to learn the gradient field of the log density, which indicates the distribution of 3D points. Specifically, in the training phase, multiple groups of tensors consisting of wavelet coefficients are applied as the input to train the network employing denoising score matching. After the model is learned, shape is iteratively updated from coarse to fine via Langevin dynamics. Experiments indicated that the present model achieves competitive performance in point cloud generation and auto-encoding, training at faster speed and lower GPU memory.
